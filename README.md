## üß† Overview

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of text expresses positive or negative emotions. In this project, we use **DistilBERT**, a lightweight version of BERT, fine-tuned on the IMDB movie review dataset to classify reviews as positive or negative.

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Model Training**: Fine-tuning DistilBERT using TensorFlow and HuggingFace.
2. **Web Interface**: Streamlit application that allows users to input custom reviews and view sentiment predictions.
